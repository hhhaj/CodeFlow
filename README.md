3. Run all cells after the current cell
4. Get feedback on successful cell execution

## Installation

2. Install the add-on in Blender (`Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`).
3. Enable the Jupyter Control add-on.

## Usage

In the Text Editor:

- Click the ➕ button to add a new cell (not necessary).
- Click the ▶️ button to run the current cell.
- Click the ⏭️ button to run all cells after the current cell.

Successful cell execution is marked with a `# CELL SUCCESS` comment.
