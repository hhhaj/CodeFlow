# Jupyter Control for Blender

Jupyter Control is a Blender add-on that brings the power of Jupyter-like cell execution to the Blender Text Editor. It allows you to create and run "cells" of Python code individually, making it easier to develop and debug your scripts.


## Features

- Add new cells of code with a single click
- Run individual cells and see the results immediately
- Run all cells after the current cell
- Get feedback on successful cell execution

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hhhaj/jupyter-control/releases).
2. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
3. Click `Install...` and select the downloaded file.
4. Enable the Jupyter Control add-on.

## Usage

After installing the add-on, you can access its features in the Text Editor:

- To add a new cell, click the ➕ button, its not necessary.
- To run the current cell, click the ▶️ button.
- To run all cells after the current cell, click the ⏭️ button.

When a cell is run successfully, a `# CELL SUCCESS` comment is temporarily added at the end of the cell.
